# 🏥 Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **diabetes classification** using **machine learning techniques**  to analyze patient data and predict diabetes risk. The goal is to develop an **efficient, scalable model** to assist healthcare providers in early diabetes detection and risk assessment. 🚑

## ❗ Problem Statement
**Diabetes** is a chronic condition that, if not diagnosed and managed early, can lead to severe complications such as **kidney failure**, **blindness**, and **cardiovascular diseases**. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on manual interpretation of medical data, which can be **time-consuming** and **prone to errors**. Additionally, identifying at-risk individuals at an early stage remains challenging due to the complexity of the underlying factors.

### ✅ **Solution**
- Develop a **machine learning-based system** to classify diabetes risk using patient data such as **glucose levels**, **BMI**, **age**, and other relevant features.
- **Improve the accuracy** 🎯 of diabetes classification through advanced ML models.
- Facilitate **early detection** ⏳ for timely interventions.
- Build an **efficient and scalable model** 📈 for healthcare providers to use in diabetes risk assessment.

## 📊 Metadata
- **Each record** represents a unique patient.
- **Columns in dataset:**
  - 🏃‍♂️ `PhysActivity`: Physical activity level.
  - 🎓 `Education`: Level of education attained.
  - 💰 `Income`: Income level of the patient.
  - 🥦 `Veggies`: Frequency of vegetable consumption.
  - 🚻 `Sex`: Gender of the patient.
  - 🍎 `Fruits`: Frequency of fruit consumption.
  - 🚬 `Smoker`: Smoking status.
  - 😔 `MentHlth`: Mental health status.
  - 🩸 `HighChol`: Presence of high cholesterol.
  - 🤕 `PhysHlth`: Physical health status.
  - 🎂 `Age`: Age of the patient.
  - ⚖️ `BMI`: Body Mass Index.
  - 💓 `HighBP`: Presence of high blood pressure.
  - 🏥 `GenHlth`: General health status.
  - 🔢 `Diabetes_012`: Target variable (0: No diabetes, 1: Pre-diabetes, 2: Diabetes).
- **Dataset Size:** 📂 100,000 records, 21 features.

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Encoding:** Label encoding for categorical columns.
- 🗑**Duplicate Handling:** Removing duplicate records.
- **Missing Values:** Imputing missing data.
- **Class Imbalance:** Applying **SMOTE**.
- **Feature Extraction & Normalization:** Selecting important features and scaling numerical values.
- **Outlier Handling:** Identifying and managing outliers.

### **2. Machine Learning Models Used**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Decision Trees (DT)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Neural Networks (NN)**

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes
- **High-accuracy ML models** 📈 for diabetes classification.
- **Efficient classification** ⚡ using hyperparameter tuning and feature selection techniques.
